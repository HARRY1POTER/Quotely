# Quotes Generator

Quotes Generator is a simple React application that fetches random quotes from an external API and displays them on the screen. It features a clean, modern design with a dark/light mode toggle, and allows users to copy quotes to the clipboard or tweet them directly. The app uses Axios for API requests and provides a seamless experience with dynamic styling using Tailwind CSS.
